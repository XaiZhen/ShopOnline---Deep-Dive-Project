ShopOnline is an E-commerce enterprise that specializes in the merchandising of gifts. This report is a general annual sales analysis for the company. The report will contain many textual analysis, tables, charts, and interactive dashboards for the reader to visualize and understand in detail.

This report comprises business insights from the analysis of data, and business opportunities and recommendations that can be observed from the analysis. In addition, there is a description of how the data preparation and analysis and visualizations were conducted.

In Section 1 - Business Insights, I have been thinking about the following questions and analyzing the data to find out the answers.
<br>

1. If a customer buys once, are they more likely to become repeat customers?
2. Are there seasonal patterns in purchasing behaviour either on a customer or country level?
3. What characteristics distinguish orders that are being cancelled from orders that are being fulfilled?
4. Is the country of a customer predictive of purchase volume?
5. What does the data show at different levels of analysis (country, items, prize range, seasons, etc.)?
6. What insights can you draw about the different customer segments?
7. How frequently are customers purchasing?
8. Are customer from certain countries purchasing more often? If so, how did you draw the conclusion?
9. What is common among high-volume weeks, months, seasons?
10. Is there an association between purchases and cancellations? If so, how did you draw the conclusion?


In Section 2 - Opportunities and Recommendations, contents focus on:
1. Value creation potential based on industry benchmarks and key performance indicators.
2. Quantified value creation opportunities and areas of improvement (provide supporting evidence - numbers, dollar figures, % change, etc.)
3.  High Impact Strategies for increasing revenue supported by data and external research.
4.  Recommendations to deliver the High Impact Strategies.


In Section 3 - Data Preparation and Analysis,
1.    Summarise features from the dataset that you used for analysis and visualisation.    Provide reasoning behind the choice of features used in the analysis.
2. Describe data quality issues in the dataset that you identified through EDA conducted in the previous project.    What underlying assumptions did I make about the data?
3. Discuss the approaches that I adopted to address data quality problems and the reasoning behind the choices.
4. Identify any other data that I would have liked for the analysis and was not available.


In Section 4 - Visualisation, it includes:
1. A dashboard
2. A infographic
